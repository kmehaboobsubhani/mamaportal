\"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\r\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\r\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\r\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\r\n *\r\n *    `isMatch` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\r\n *\r\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\r\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\r\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\r\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `isMatch` will try to match a number\r\n *      as wide as the sequence\r\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `isMatch` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\r\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\r\n *\r\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\r\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\r\n *\r\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\r\n *\r\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\r\n *    |------|-----|-----|\r\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\r\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\r\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\r\n *\r\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\r\n *\r\n *    `isMatch('50', 'yy') //=> true`\r\n *\r\n *    `isMatch('75', 'yy') //=> true`\r\n *\r\n *    while `uu` will use the year as is:\r\n *\r\n *    `isMatch('50', 'uu') //=> true`\r\n *\r\n *    `isMatch('75', 'uu') //=> true`\r\n *\r\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\r\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\r\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\r\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\r\n *\r\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\r\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\r\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\r\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\r\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\r\n *    - `P`: long localized date\r\n *    - `p`: long localized time\r\n *\r\n * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\r\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\r\n *\r\n * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\r\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\r\n *\r\n * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\r\n *    on the given locale.\r\n *\r\n *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\r\n *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\r\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\r\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\r\n *\r\n * Values will be checked in the descending order of its unit's priority.\r\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\r\n *\r\n * If no values of higher priority are matched (e.g. when matching string 'January 1st' without a year),\r\n * the values will be taken from today's using `new Date()` date which works as a context of parsing.\r\n *\r\n * The result may vary by locale.\r\n *\r\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @param {String} dateString - the date string to verify\r\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\r\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\r\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

\"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\r\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\r\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular.\r\n *    In `format` function, they will produce different result:\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\r\n *\r\n *    `parse` will try to match both formatting and stand-alone units interchangably.\r\n *\r\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\r\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\r\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table:\r\n *    - for numerical units (`yyyyyyyy`) `parse` will try to match a number\r\n *      as wide as the sequence\r\n *    - for text units (`MMMMMMMM`) `parse` will try to match the widest variation of the unit.\r\n *      These variations are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\r\n *\r\n * 3. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\r\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\r\n *\r\n * 4. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\r\n *\r\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\r\n *    |------|-----|-----|\r\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\r\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\r\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\r\n *\r\n *    Also `yy` will try to guess the century of two digit year by proximity with `referenceDate`:\r\n *\r\n *    `parse('50', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 2050 00:00:00`\r\n *\r\n *    `parse('75', 'yy', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Wed Jan 01 1975 00:00:00`\r\n *\r\n *    while `uu` will just assign the year as is:\r\n *\r\n *    `parse('50', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Sat Jan 01 0050 00:00:00`\r\n *\r\n *    `parse('75', 'uu', new Date(2018, 0, 1)) //=> Tue Jan 01 0075 00:00:00`\r\n *\r\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\r\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\r\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [setISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setISOWeekYear}\r\n *    and [setWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/setWeekYear}).\r\n *\r\n * 5. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\r\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\r\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\r\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\r\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\r\n *    - `P`: long localized date\r\n *    - `p`: long localized time\r\n *\r\n * 6. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\r\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\r\n *\r\n * 7. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\r\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\r\n *\r\n * 8. `P+` tokens do not have a defined priority since they are merely aliases to other tokens based\r\n *    on the given locale.\r\n *\r\n *    using `en-US` locale: `P` => `MM/dd/yyyy`\r\n *    using `en-US` locale: `p` => `hh:mm a`\r\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `P` => `dd/MM/yyyy`\r\n *    using `pt-BR` locale: `p` => `HH:mm`\r\n *\r\n * Values will be assigned to the date in the descending order of its unit's priority.\r\n * Units of an equal priority overwrite each other in the order of appearance.\r\n *\r\n * If no values of higher priority are parsed (e.g. when parsing string 'January 1st' without a year),\r\n * the values will be taken from 3rd argument `referenceDate` which works as a context of parsing.\r\n *\r\n * `referenceDate` must be passed for correct work of the function.\r\n * If you're not sure which `referenceDate` to supply, create a new instance of Date:\r\n * `parse('02/11/2014', 'MM/dd/yyyy', new Date())`\r\n * In this case parsing will be done in the context of the current date.\r\n * If `referenceDate` is `Invalid Date` or a value not convertible to valid `Date`,\r\n * then `Invalid Date` will be returned.\r\n *\r\n * The result may vary by locale.\r\n *\r\n * If `formatString` matches with `dateString` but does not provides tokens, `referenceDate` will be returned.\r\n *\r\n * If parsing failed, `Invalid Date` will be returned.\r\n * Invalid Date is a Date, whose time value is NaN.\r\n * Time value of Date: http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.1.1\r\n *\r\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\r\n *\r\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\r\n *\r\n * - Old `parse` was renamed to `toDate`.\r\n *   Now `parse` is a new function which parses a string using a provided format.\r\n *\r\n *   ```javascript\r\n *   // Before v2.0.0\r\n *   parse('2016-01-01')\r\n *\r\n *   // v2.0.0 onward (toDate no longer accepts a string)\r\n *   toDate(1392098430000) // Unix to timestamp\r\n *   toDate(new Date(2014, 1, 11, 11, 30, 30)) // Cloning the date\r\n *   parse('2016-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd', new Date())\r\n *   ```\r\n *\r\n * @param {String} dateString - the string to parse\r\n * @param {String} formatString - the string of tokens\r\n * @param {Date|Number} referenceDate - defines values missing from the parsed dateString\r\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\r\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.

\"Formatting\" units (e.g. formatting quarter) in the default en-US locale\r\n *    are the same as \"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\r\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\r\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular:\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\r\n *\r\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\r\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\r\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)\r\n *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually\r\n *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units\r\n *    are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\r\n *\r\n * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).\r\n *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.\r\n *\r\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`\r\n *\r\n * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\r\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\r\n *\r\n * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\r\n *\r\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\r\n *    |------|-----|-----|\r\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\r\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\r\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\r\n *\r\n *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,\r\n *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:\r\n *\r\n *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |\r\n *    |------|------|------|\r\n *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |\r\n *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |\r\n *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |\r\n *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |\r\n *\r\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\r\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\r\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}\r\n *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).\r\n *\r\n * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,\r\n *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.\r\n *\r\n * 7.
